# Dreamland
### Open-source text-based RPG for Android

![Dreamland Preview](https://i.imgur.com/vR1Tnb3.png)

Dreamland is a personal project, a simple text-based RPG game made in Kotlin and Android Studio, using no game engine at all.

#### What is it about?
You created a character based on three starting classes - Barbarian, Ranger and Sorcerer. Each class has their own starting Healt, Attack, and Defense points, which impact in your daily adventures.

You will get Experience, as well as Gold when Hunting or going in daily Adventures.

In order to recover health, or improve your equipment, there is a Shop where you can spend your Gold on to continue your journey.

Main plan is to start small, and upgrade the game as soon as I can on my free time.
